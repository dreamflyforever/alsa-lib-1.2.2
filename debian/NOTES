            MAINTAINER NOTES
	    for alsa-lib
            ----------------

libasound3
----------
libasound2 includes /usr/bin/aserver which should be in a libasound2-bin
package.

We build libasound2-dev, making it appear that we are prepared to
support multiple simultaneous -dev packages in the future.  However,
libasound2-dev uses generically named directories such as
/usr/include/alsa/.  A future libasound3-dev should probably use
/usr/include/asound3/ instead.

jack
----
alsa-lib includes a jack-audio-connection-kit plugin, distributed in
the libasound2-plugins package.  In order to build this, alsa-lib needs
to Build-Depend on libjack0.80.0-dev whose source package at the same
time Build-Depends on libasound2-dev.  This circular build dependency
cannot be satisified when bootstrapping Debian for a new architecture.
(Note that "libjack0.80.0-dev" may have been renamed to something with
a higher version number by the time you read this.)

To work around this problem and build alsa-lib without installing
libjack0.80.0-dev, set the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS environment variable to
include the string "no-jack-dep" and temporarily remove
"libjack0.80.0-dev" from the Build-Depends list.  The result will be
that the libasound2-plugins package contains a bogus empty
libasound_module_pcm_jack library.  Once libasound2 and libasound2-dev
have been built this way, jack-audio-connection-kit can be built,
providing libjack0.80.0-dev, and then you can rebuild alsa-lib without
"no-jack-dep".
